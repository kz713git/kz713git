- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kz713git
- ðŸ‘€ This is me. â†“

    - Difficulty with glaring light
    - Sensitive to smells
    - I get energized by meeting people
    - I am lonely and like to fill up a lot of my schedule
    - In a quiet room, the ticking of the clock bothers me
    - I am bothered by the sound of the person sitting next to me tapping on the keyboard
    - I feel dreadfully tired when I go home after a day of meeting with friends
    - I buy products that I have liked for a long time rather than new products
    - I never make impulse purchases
    - I worry about little things that make me cringe
    - I worry about people sitting far away from me at a drinking party who look bored.
    - I am indecisive and can't make a decision about anything
    - You have trouble sleeping when you change your environment
    - Worried about whether the electricity or gas is turned off when you leave home
    - I'm good at reading what others are thinking
